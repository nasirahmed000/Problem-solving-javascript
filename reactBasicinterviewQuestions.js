Here are some common **React.js interview questions** along with their brief explanations to help you prepare:

---

### **Basic React Questions:**
1. **What is React?**
   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily focused on developing single-page applications. It follows a component-based architecture.

2. **What are the main features of React?**
   - Virtual DOM
   - JSX (JavaScript XML)
   - Component-based architecture
   - Unidirectional data flow
   - Lifecycle methods

3. **What is the Virtual DOM?**
   The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize updates by comparing the current and previous states (diffing algorithm) and applying changes efficiently to the real DOM.

4. **What is JSX?**
   JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
   ```

5. **What are React components?**
   React components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either:
   - **Functional components:** JavaScript functions that return JSX.
   - **Class components:** ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.

### **Intermediate React Questions:**
6. **What is the difference between a functional and class component?**
   - **Functional components:** Simple, stateless, and use hooks for state and lifecycle.
   - **Class components:** Stateful and have access to lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`.

7. **What are props in React?**
   Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent to child components. They are immutable.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   function Greeting(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
   }
   ```

8. **What is state in React?**
   State is a built-in object that allows components to maintain their own data and update it when necessary. Unlike props, state is mutable.

9. **What is the difference between state and props?**
   - **Props:** Passed from parent to child and are immutable.
   - **State:** Managed within a component and can change over time.

10. **What are React lifecycle methods?**
    These are special methods in class components that allow you to hook into different phases of a component's life. Examples:
    - `componentDidMount`
    - `componentDidUpdate`
    - `componentWillUnmount`

---

### **Advanced React Questions:**
11. **What are hooks in React?**
    Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include:
    - `useState`
    - `useEffect`
    - `useContext`

12. **What is `useEffect` used for?**
    It performs side effects in functional components, like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

    Example:
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log("Component mounted or updated");
      return () => console.log("Cleanup on unmount");
    }, []);
    ```

13. **What is Context API?**
    The Context API allows you to share data (like theme or user information) across the component tree without passing props manually through every level.

14. **What is React Router?**
    React Router is a library used for navigation in React applications. It allows the creation of single-page applications with dynamic routing.

15. **What are higher-order components (HOC)?**
    HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component, adding extra functionality.

    Example:
    ```jsx
    const withLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
      return (props) => {
        console.log("Props:", props);
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
      };
    };
    ```

### **Coding and Problem-Solving Questions:**
16. **How do you manage state in a React app?**
    - Using `useState` for local state.
    - Using `useReducer` for complex state logic.
    - Using Context API or libraries like Redux for global state.

17. **How would you optimize a React application?**
    - Use React.memo or `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
    - Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense.
    - Use proper key props in lists.

18. **How would you handle forms in React?**
    By using controlled components:
    ```jsx
    const [value, setValue] = useState("");
    return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
    ```

19. **How does React handle events?**
    React uses a synthetic event system, which is a cross-browser wrapper around native events.

20. **What is Redux and how does it work with React?**
    Redux is a state management library. It uses a single store to hold the application's state and updates it using actions and reducers.
