// In JavaScript, the ternary operator is a concise way to write a conditional (if-else) statement. It is also known as the conditional operator. The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

---> condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

var isSunny = true;

var weather = isSunny ? "It's a sunny day!" : "It's not sunny today.";

console.log(weather);
